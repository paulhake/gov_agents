# Summary of 10 Client Reviews - Comprehensive Analysis

## Overall Review Quality Ranking (Best to Worst)

### 1. **Box (Anthony) - EXCELLENT** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**What Made It Great:**
- **Data-driven insights**: Showed actual usage graphs and caught Box routing traffic to OpenAI
- **Proactive monitoring**: Team noticed consumption drops and investigated 
- **Clear escalation**: Brought issue to CIO office appropriately
- **Strategic thinking**: Working on agent catalog integration and governance workshops
- **Honest assessment**: Acknowledged $1.5M target is challenging but had multiple approaches

**Key Quote:** *"Box had done some work around Fed granite... they switched over to OpenAI. So from April to mid June, you can see very low usage... they fixed it within a couple of days"*

**Coaching Reinforcement:** This is world-class account management - proactive monitoring, data analysis, and swift issue resolution.

### 2. **Adobe (Tim) - EXCELLENT** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**What Made It Great:**
- Clear financial context: $21.5M ESA with detailed breakdown
- Honest about challenges: "We have a long ways to go to get to 21.5 million"
- Strategic focus on competitive threat: Adobe building their own "Majing Orchestrator"
- Specific next steps: Meeting with Alex Falka (lead architect)
- Great use of visuals: Showed internal Adobe environment with IBM watsonx home
- Acknowledged resource needs and got commitment for feedback sessions

**Coaching Reinforcement:** This is the gold standard - Tim balanced optimism with realism and had a clear competitive strategy.

### 3. **IPG (Paul) - VERY GOOD** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**What Made It Great:**
- **Honest and appropriate status**: Red accurately reflects no immediate embed path due to merger disruption
- **Excellent pivot strategy**: When embed was killed by Omnicom merger, immediately found internal use cases
- **Leveraged existing relationships**: Built on strong IBM Consulting presence ($60-80M annually in services)
- **Technical momentum maintained**: Testing POC progressing well with governance planned for Phase 2
- **Future positioning**: Planned for better Omnicom relationship post-merger
- **Creative problem-solving**: Shifted from paid to presales services when budget was pulled
- **Multi-pronged approach**: Found subsidiary opportunities (Axion), CIO bootcamp, agent integration

**Key Insight:** This is how you handle external disruption - you can't control M&A events, but you can control your response.

### 4. **Fiserv (Jeff) - GOOD** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Strengths:**
- Clear contract details: $40M ESA with specific license breakdown
- Two pilots successfully moving to production
- Realistic about challenges: "bought more than they needed"
- Good transition planning to IBM Consulting

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Unclear on HCI Fusion embed implications (Carlo had to ask for clarification)
- Limited strategy for consuming the massive $40M contract
- Needs stronger roadmap for additional use cases

### 5. **Rocket Software (Nagi) - GOOD** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Strengths:**
- Good technical detail on contract structure ($34M, extended to December)
- Clear explanation of MovWorks acquisition by ServiceNow creating opportunity
- Specific POC details (PL1 transfer, automation workflow)
- Honest about challenges with PLO code

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Status rationale was weak - "yellow because journey started" isn't compelling
- Needed Carlo's help to articulate why yellow vs red/green
- Could have been more strategic about the ServiceNow disruption opportunity

### 6. **SAP (Richard/Charu) - AVERAGE** ⭐⭐⭐
**Strengths:**
- Good partnership size ($43M Germany + $13M US)
- Clear product breakdown (data, governance, AI)
- Honest about team disruption (lost CSM and architect)

**Major Issues:**
- **Charu directly contradicted Richard on AI progress** - this was unprofessional and confusing
- Richard seemed unprepared for the governance details
- Weak agent strategy despite Carlo's emphasis
- 4:45 AM call excuse was unprofessional (though understandable)

**Critical Coaching Point:** Never contradict your teammate publicly. Handle disagreements offline.

### 7. **Seismic (Anand) - POOR** ⭐⭐
**Major Problems:**
- **Waiting on product for months** instead of engaging customer
- No customer interactions since June workshops despite $2M contract
- Unclear on what "MCP support" actually means vs. what's available
- Renewal at risk in December with minimal progress
- Had to be coached by Carlo on basic relationship management

**Critical Quote:** *"We weren't ready, Carlo, from a product standpoint, but were we gonna talk to them about their agents when we couldn't even get anything going?"*

**Coaching Point:** This is backwards thinking - you engage customers regardless of product limitations and work around them.

### 8. **Sirion (Lana) - POOR** ⭐⭐
**Major Problems:**
- **Massive cost overrun**: 800 hours budgeted, 3,000 hours spent (~$1M in services)
- Account is basically IBM's contract repository, not a real partnership
- Getting pulled into support tickets instead of strategic work
- Consumption is primarily infrastructure, not Watson X
- No clear strategy for moving forward despite massive investment

**Critical Reality:** This isn't a partner relationship - IBM is providing free services to its own CIO office.

### 9. **D&B (Rogan) - POOR** ⭐⭐
**Major Problems:**
- Confused ESA sizing (96M vs 71M) - came unprepared with basic facts
- Fundamental issue: Building deployments with NO SALES MOTION
- "They rely a lot on IBM to go to market" - this is a red flag he didn't address
- Vague action items with no clear ownership or timeline
- Carlo had to coach him extensively on what questions to ask

**Coaching Points:**
- Come prepared with accurate financials
- Don't build technology without a sales strategy
- Take ownership of client relationship issues instead of blaming them

### 10. **Juniper (Shivam) - VERY POOR** ⭐
**Critical Failures:**
- **Two failed pilots in a row** - chose Perplexity over IBM
- No active work despite $4M deal signed in Q3 2024
- Renewal at risk in Q3 with nothing to show
- Reactive approach: "I will follow up" without concrete plans
- Carlo had to offer to call the client directly because of lack of progress

**Harsh Reality Check:** This account is dying and Shivam seems passive about it.

## Key Coaching Points for the Team

### 1. **Monitor Your Data Like Box (Gold Standard)**
Anthony's team caught Box routing traffic to competitors through data analysis. Every team should be monitoring consumption patterns and investigating anomalies. This is how you protect your partnerships.

### 2. **Handle External Disruption Like IPG**
Paul showed how to respond when external factors (M&A) kill your primary strategy:
- Immediately pivot to alternative approaches
- Leverage existing relationships and strengths
- Maintain technical momentum
- Position for future opportunities
- **Don't just wait for external events to resolve**

### 3. **Don't Wait on Product - Engage Anyway**
Seismic shows the wrong approach. Anand waited months for "MCP support" instead of having regular customer touchpoints. **You can scope, plan, and build relationships while waiting for product features.**

### 4. **Never Publicly Contradict Teammates**
- SAP review was damaged by Charu contradicting Richard
- Handle disagreements in private
- Present a united front to leadership

### 5. **Have a Sales Strategy Before Building**
- D&B is building deployments with no sales motion
- Technology without commercial strategy is waste
- Ask "who's buying this and why?" before building

### 6. **Be Proactive, Not Reactive**
- Juniper showed pure reactive management
- "I will follow up" is not a strategy
- Come with concrete next steps and timelines

### 7. **Balance Honesty with Solutions**
- Adobe and IPG did this perfectly - honest about challenges but had clear strategies
- Don't just report problems, propose solutions
- Show you understand the business impact

### 8. **Cost Discipline is Critical**
Sirion's 4x cost overrun ($800K → $3M in services) with minimal consumption is unacceptable. When build funds are exhausted, transition to paid services or stop work.

### 9. **Come Prepared with Accurate Data**
- D&B's ESA confusion was embarrassing
- Know your contract values, dates, and status cold
- If you don't know, find out before the meeting

### 10. **Agent Strategy is Mandatory**
- Carlo emphasized this multiple times across all accounts
- Every account should have an agent play identified
- This is clearly a company priority

## Bottom Line Message for the Team

**The gap between top performers (Box, Adobe, IPG) and failing accounts (Juniper, D&B) shows this isn't about account size, product readiness, or external factors - it's about preparation, ownership, strategic thinking, and adaptability.**

**Top performers:**
- Monitor data proactively (Box)
- Balance honesty with strategy (Adobe)
- Adapt quickly to disruption (IPG)

**Poor performers:**
- Wait for perfect conditions (Seismic)
- Come unprepared (D&B)
- Show no ownership (Juniper)

**Carlo's frustration with some reviews was justified** - when he offers to call clients directly, that's not help, that's taking over your job. Own your relationships and come with solutions, not excuses.

The difference between success and failure is active relationship management, data monitoring, strategic thinking, and the ability to adapt when circumstances change.
